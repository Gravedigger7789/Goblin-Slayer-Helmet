# Summary

I fixed most of the model issues that blender and mesh mixer were complaining about from the source model.

I have not printed this yet but I plan on printing it. Once I scale, slice, and print it I will update this model with the sliced pieces

Feel free to modify the blender file as needed to export different poly count models. The blender file contains both the boolean joined helmet (without the modifiers applied) and all the individual pieces

**Updates**
*3/23/19* - Made all the edges sharp again! I also scaled it to 63% so it should fit now, I have not tested it but after I do so I will update the scale if required.

*3/18/19* - Fixed chin mesh, added exports for High and Med poly using the Catmull Subsurf modifier, and made it one shell. This should make splitting in Meshmixer easier.

*3/1/19* - Fixed all the non-manifold edges in the source helmet
